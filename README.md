# Modelling-of-hydrogen-energy-system
This model was developed as part of the CO2InnO project, which was financed by Interreg co. 

This simulation model demonstrates the application of a decentralised hydrogen-based energy system with a gas engine CHP and local hydrogen production.
## Background to the project topic:

As part of the cross-border CO2InnO project, the GenLab research centre at Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences is working
Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, together with French and German universities and public
hydrogen-based energy system. In addition to the physical energy system in the GenLab,
a simulation model is being developed. This model depicts the energy system with its subsystems and enables
to simulate different load profiles and operating strategies.

## Task of the project:

The work includes the development of a simulation model that maps the operating characteristics of a hydrogen-based energy system.
The simulation model is to be validated with real measurement data.
In addition, users are to use the model to simulate their own energy requirements
and carry out user-specific dimensioning of the hydrogen-based energy system.
The simulation model is being developed in consultation with the project partners.
