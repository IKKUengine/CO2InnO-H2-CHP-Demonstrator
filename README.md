# Modelling-of-hydrogen-energy-system

## Background to the project topic:

As part of the cross-border CO2InnO project, the GenLab research centre at Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences is working
Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences, together with French and German universities and public
hydrogen-based energy system. In addition to the physical energy system in the GenLab,
a simulation model is being developed. This model depicts the energy system with its subsystems and enables
to simulate different load profiles and operating strategies.

## Task of the project:

The work includes the development of a simulation model that maps the operating characteristics of a hydrogen-based energy system.
hydrogen-based energy system. The simulation model is to be validated with real measurement data.
In addition, users are to use the model to simulate their own energy requirements and to develop a
and carry out user-specific dimensioning of the hydrogen-based energy system. The
The simulation model is being developed in consultation with the project partners. The results will be
documented and presented.

## Note:

Remeber to change the file paths in both Energysystem and Subsystem for the load profils. In Subsystems a excel file in the same style as given should be used.
For the Model "Subsystems" the following libaries must be installed and opend in your OpenModelica Version:

## Update:

In EXE2 m√ºssen die Pfade nicht mehr angepasst werden!
